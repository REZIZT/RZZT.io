		<h2>Funding beneficial open-source projects.</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>RZZT funds the development of free and open-source software (FOSS) projects that respect, protect and fulfill human rights and civil liberties. We are especially focused on funding projects that encourage economic empowerment of individuals, promote freedom of speech, and protect privacy. Read our statement of principles <a href="https://rzzt.io/statement-of-principles.html">here</a>.</p>
			<p>FOSS projects often fail because they lack consistent and guaranteed funding. We want to ensure that developers and other contributors can focus on creating great software, without worrying about their bank balances.</p>

		<h2>How we raise and spend money.</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>RZZT raises funds through donations and sponsorships, and intends to secure additional sources of income such as grants. When you donate to RZZT, you will be able to choose whether your money is used for a specific project, or whether RZZT can distribute it on a needs basis to any funded project. Your donations are pooled together so that developers can be hired for the relevant project or projects.</p>
			<p>We hope to ensure that those working hard on the projects we fund are not reliant on micro-donations. We want to provide them with fixed contracts and guaranteed, consistent income for their hard work.</p>
			<p>Our first priority is funding the development of Taskhive, a cross-platform decentralised marketplace for creative freelancers. Taskhive will empower individuals to seek and offer services, negotiate contracts, and take advantage of secure technologies that protect them from being ripped-off.</p>

			<div class="project-heading">
				<h3>Taskhive</h3>
				<span class="subtitle">A secure p2p freelance marketplace</span>
			</div>
			<p>RZZT's first officially-funded project will be <a href="https://taskhive.io">Taskhive</a>. RZZT is in discussions with the project's coordinators to determine priorities for development, with a view to engaging a developer or developers to work on the project.</p>
			<p>When completed, Taskhive will be a feeless marketplace for individuals and businesses to engage the services of freelancers. Its focus is on decentralisation and individual choice in trade and commerce.</p>
			<p>Taskhive will empower freelancers and their clients, while allowing them to control their personal information. Combined with the decentralised approach, Taskhive will protect privacy and resist censorship, while including mechanisms to promote trust and build user reputations</p>

		<h2>Transparent and accountable.</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>At RZZT, we believe in corporate transparency and accountability. With that in mind, we will publish as many of our company records as possible online, including <a href="https://rzzt.io/accounts/summary.html">accounts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RZZT/Company-Documents/tree/master/Minutes">minutes</a>. We want RZZT to be a name associated with trust and integrity.</p>
			<p>We also strive to keep administrative costs to a minimum. As a result, we have no full-time staff and are entirely operated by three elected Directors and a Company Secretary, to maximise the funds available for development of open-source software.</p>

		<h2>A community interest company &mdash; literally.</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>RZZT is <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10951485">incorporated as a community interest company</a> in the United Kingdom as a matter of convenience. Our <a href="https://rzzt.io/articles-of-association">Articles of Association</a> require us to use any surplus or assets for the benefit of the community.</a>
			<p>While the human rights situation in the UK is not ideal, RZZT does not develop software itself and so it cannot be forced to include nasty backdoors. Even if it could, the open-source community would respond by auditing the code into oblivion!</p>
			<p>As part of our planned activities, we will also give out awards acknowledging those who make significant non-financial contributions toward building a vibrant open-source and free culture community. We believe that those people who work hard to benefit society ought to be recognised for making the world a better place.</p>
