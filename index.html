			<h2>Funding beneficial open-source projects.</h2>
			<div class="content">
				<p>RZZT intends to fund free and open-sources software projects that respect, protect and fulfill human rights and civil liberties. We are especially interested in funding projects that encourage economic empowerment of individuals, promote freedom of speech, and protect privacy.</p>
				<p>Open-source software projects often fail because they lack consistent funding. We want to ensure that developers and other contributors can focus on creating great software, without worrying about their bank balances.</p>

			<h2>How we raise and spend money.</h2>
			<div class="content">
				<p>RZZT will initially raise funds through donations and sponsorships, and has long-term plans to secure addition sources of income. When you donate to RZZT, you can choose whether your money is used for a specific project, or whether RZZT can distribute it on a needs basis to any funded project. Your donations are pooled together so that developers can be hired for the relevant project or projects.</p>
				<p>We hope to ensure that those working hard on the projects we fund are not reliant on micro-donations. We want to provide them with fixed contracts and guaranteed, consistent income for their hard work.</p>
				<p>Our first priority will be funding the development of Taskhive, a cross-platform decentralised marketplace for creative freelancers. Taskhive empowers individuals to seek and offer services, negotiate contracts, and take advantage of secure technologies that protect them from being ripped-off.</p>

			<h2>A community interest company &mdash; literally.</h2>
			<div class="content">
				<p>RZZT will be incorporated as a community interest company in the United Kingdom as a matter of convenience. While the human rights situation in the UK is not ideal, RZZT will not develop software itself and so it cannot be forced to include nasty backdoors. Even if it could, the open-source community would respond by auditing the code into oblivion.</p>
				<p>As part of our planned activities, we also intend to give out awards acknowledging those who make significant non-financial contributions toward building a vibrant open-source and free culture community. We beleve that those people who work hard to benefit society ought to be recognised for making the world a better place.</p>

			<h2>Transparent and accountable.</h2>
			<div class="content">
				<p>At RZZT, we believe in corporate transparency and accountability. With that in mind, we will publish as many of our company records as possible online, including accounts and minutes. We want to be a name associated with trust and integrity.</p>
				<p>We also strive to keep administrative costs to a minimum. As a result, we will have no full-time staff and will be entirely operated by three elected Directors and a secretary, to maximise the funds available for development of open-source software.</p>
